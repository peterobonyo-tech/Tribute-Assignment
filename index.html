<p><b>The Father of democracy</b></p>
<p>Raila was a brother, friend, and patriot whose life was dedicated to the service of Kenya.
Raila’s passing left my heart heavy, we shared struggles, moments of unity, and vision for a better Kenya would remain etched in history. 
I loved Raila’s resilience, courage in the face of adversity, and unwavering commitment to democracy, justice, and the rights of all Kenyans.</p>


<h4>NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Most effective opposition leader in Kenya history</li>
<li>Prime Minister of Kenya</li>
<li>Roads Minister in NARC Government</li>
    </ul>



<p>Rest well, Baba.</p>
